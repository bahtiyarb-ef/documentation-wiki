Examples/Use Case
---------
Nessus is primarily thought of as a system used to identify which vulnerabilities exist in an environment. While it does extremely well at this it has other equally important uses. One use case often overlooked is using Nessus to performed authenticated scans with no vulnerability checks. What this provides is a list authorized and potentially unauthorized devices. When combined with a SIEM this can be extremely powerful.

Another more common use case is to automatically correlate vulnerability data against alerts. This can help prioritize alerts.
