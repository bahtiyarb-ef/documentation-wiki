# Bugs or Suggestions

Please let us know if you find any bugs in the courseware/labs/wiki we need to squash. Also, reach out if you have suggestions to improve the course (e.g. content/labs/tools that should be added, removed, or updated). The easiest way to submit these improvements is by sending an email to **<justin@hasecuritysolutions.com>**
